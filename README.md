# Arcadeum

Welcome to the ARCADEUM.network

Arcadeum is a collection of Solidity smart contracts as well as a TypeScript library for verifying turn-based games implemented as finite state machines in Solidity.


## Usage / Dev

**Tools:**

1. Install node v8.x or v9.x
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn bootstrap`
4. `yarn build`


### Client

1. `cd client/`
2. `yarn test`
3. `yarn build`


### Ethereum

1. `cd ethereum/`
2. `yarn ganache` -- run in a separate terminal and import one of the private keys other than the first one into MetaMask
3. `yarn migrate`


### Server

1. `cd server/`
2. `make run`


### Running TTT example

1. `cd examples/ttt/`
2. `yarn install` -- this is required because `ttt` is configured outside of the arcadeum workspace
3. `yarn build` -- this will compile the TTT.sol ethereum contract
4. `yarn migrate` -- migrate the contract to the ganache testrpc
5. `yarn dev` -- this will start the webapp on http://localhost:3000/


# TODO, Build Optimizations

* ethereum/
  * dedicated abi.json files for each contract

* client/
  * why is filesize so large? minified at 544 kb for such a small code-base
  * analyze bundle size
  * potentially refactor out rxjs if turns out to be adding weight
